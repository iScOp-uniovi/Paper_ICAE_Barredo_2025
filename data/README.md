# Data Folder

## 📄 Description
This folder contains the datasets used in the experiments for the paper:

> **"Multiobjective Cooperative Multi-Fitness in Workflow Scheduling problem"**
>  
> (Submitted to **Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering (ICAE)**.
> Authors: Author Pablo Barredo, Jorge Puente
>
>DOI: [Pending Assignment]
>
> URI: [Pending Assignment]

These datasets were used to evaluate the performance of an evolutionary algorithm for workflow scheduling in cloud computing environments.

## 📂 Folder Structure

For each algorithm, there are the following folders:

- `workflows/` → Contains scientific workflow instances extracted from **WfCommons** ([version 1.4](https://github.com/wfcommons/WfInstances/tree/main/pegasus)).
- `hosts/` → Contains different **IaaS configurations** used during experimentation.
- `experiment` → Contains the scripts and the configuration file necessary to launch the same experiment as the one made for this paper.

## 🔍 Workflow Instances
The **scientific workflow instances** in this repository originate from the **WfCommons** repository:

🔗 **WfCommons v1.4**: [https://github.com/wfcommons/WfInstances/tree/main/pegasus](https://github.com/wfcommons/WfInstances/tree/main/pegasus)

To ensure reproducibility, we use version **1.4** of these instances.
